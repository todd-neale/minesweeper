# Minesweeper

# Background
Based on the classic game, Minesweeper. I tried to recreate the game mechanics as close to the classic as possible.

## How to play
The board is divided into tiles. There may be a mine behind a tile or not. Your goal to open/sweep all tiles with no mine behind. If you click on a mine tile you lose. If you sweep all the mines, you win.

When you click on a tile with no mine, it will show how many mines are surrounding that tile; use this to help you. If that number is none, the tile will cascade and open up adjacent tiles with no surrounding mines.

You can also cntrl or right-click tiles to flag them as an indicator to yourself that you think there is a mine there. At the start of the game, you are given as many flags as there are bombs. The top-left counter is your flags left.

Click the restart button to restart the game.
